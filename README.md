# JavaCodeEcorification
This is a proof of concept for the ecorification of Java code. The Java code will be interlaced with the generated model code of an Ecore metamodel that was extracted from the original Java code with the help of the [EcoreMetamodelExtraction project](https://github.com/tsaglam/EcoreMetamodelExtraction).
